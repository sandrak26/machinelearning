>Brain Stroke Prediction ML Project
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of a person experiencing a brain stroke based on various health indicators and demographic factors. The dataset used for this project contains information such as age, hypertension status, heart disease status, average glucose level, body mass index (BMI), and smoking status.

>Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Stroke Prediction Dataset from Kaggle, which contains 5110 entries and 12 columns.

>Technologies Used
Python,
Jupyter Notebook,
Pandas,
NumPy,
Scikit-learn,
Matplotlib,
Seaborn,

>Machine Learning Models
We will explore various machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting to predict the likelihood of a brain stroke.
